This is my own personal lab expirement. The goal is to get familar with linux, VMs, github, web servers, etc.. I will be setting up a website on my internal virtual network that can communicate with
my lan. There will be a SQL server also attached to it. 

This is all done with headless Debian installs. I might add a few Windows or GUI Linux OSs later, but the bulk will be Debian.

The VMs are all managed by KVM.
